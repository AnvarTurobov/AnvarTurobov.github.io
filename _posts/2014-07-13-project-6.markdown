description: The aim of this game is to complete a mathematic equation by selecting the correct operator (plus, minus, multiply or divide). The challenge is that the operators appear in a random order, and are hidden after a set amount of time. The user must assess the unfinished equation, and remember where the correct operator is before they are hidden.If the user selects the correct operator they progress to the next level. The time that the operators are shown starts at 2 seconds and decreases with each new level. The build HTML 5, CSS3 and JavaScript were used to create this game. Animation was created using the Animate.css stylesheet.
